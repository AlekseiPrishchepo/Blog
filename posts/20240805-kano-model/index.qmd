# Kano Method for Prioritization of Features

The Kano model is a theory for product development and customer
satisfaction developed in the 1980s by Professor Noriaki Kano. The model
classifies customer preferences into five categories: Must-be Quality,
One-dimensional Quality, Attractive Quality, Indifferent Quality, and
Reverse Quality. The Kano model is used to prioritize features and
functionalities in product development based on customer needs and
expectations.

## Categories of the Kano Model

### Must-be Quality

Must-be Quality features are basic requirements that customers expect.
If these features are not present in a product, customers will be
dissatisfied. However, the presence of these features does not
necessarily lead to customer satisfaction. Must-be Quality features are
considered essential for the product.

> Examples: a car must have wheels, a smartphone must have a battery, a
> website must have a search function.

### One-dimensional Quality

One-dimensional Quality features are directly proportional to customer
satisfaction. The more these features are present in a product, the more
satisfied customers will be. These features are usually explicitly
stated by customers and are easy to measure and quantify.

> Examples: a car with leather seats, a smartphone with a
> high-resolution camera, a website with fast loading times.

### Attractive Quality

Attractive Quality features are unexpected features that delight
customers. These features are not explicitly requested by customers but
can create a positive emotional response when present. Attractive
Quality features can differentiate a product from its competitors and
create a competitive advantage.

> Examples: a car with a built-in navigation system, a smartphone with
> facial recognition technology, a website with personalized
> recommendations.

### Indifferent Quality

Indifferent Quality features are neither good nor bad from the
customer's perspective. Customers are indifferent to these features, and
their presence or absence does not significantly impact customer
satisfaction. These features are often considered "nice to have" but not
essential.

> Examples: a car with cup holders, a smartphone with a stylus, a
> website with social media integration.

### Reverse Quality

Reverse Quality features are features that, when present, can lead to
customer dissatisfaction. These features may be perceived as unnecessary
or even annoying by customers. It is essential to identify and eliminate
Reverse Quality features to prevent negative customer experiences.

> Examples: a car with uncomfortable seats, a smartphone with a short
> battery life, a website with intrusive pop-up ads.

## Prioritizing Features with the Kano Model

With the Kano model, prioritization of features and functionalities
becomes clear and straightforward as that:

**a)** keep eye on the Must-be Quality features, as they are essential,
**b)** incorporate One-dimensional Quality features to increase customer
satisfaction, **c)** consider Attractive Quality features to create a
competitive advantage; **d)** eliminate Reverse Quality features
completely, and **e)** save resources by setting Indifferent Quality
features as low priority.

## Implementation

Implementing the Kano model involves a sequence of steps, beginning with the development of a questionnaire. For each feature, two types of questions are posed: functional and dysfunctional. Each question offers five possible responses, from "I like it" to "I dislike it." Subsequently, these responses are classified into the five Kano categories.

```{python iterp}
#| echo: false
#| label: tbl-cap-margin
#| cap-location: top
#| tbl-cap: "Interpretation of answers to the Kano questionnaire."
#| tbl-cap-location: top
#| 
import pandas as pd

interp = pd.read_csv("data/kano-interp.csv")

interp.groupby(["Functional", "Dysfunctional"]).agg({"Category": "first"}).unstack()
```


$$ \text{Satisfaction} = \dfrac{(A + O) }{ ( A + O + M + I ) } \times 100 $$

$$ \text{Dissatisfaction} =  - \dfrac{(O + M) }{ ( A + O + M + I ) } \times 100 $$

## Application of the Kano Model

The Kano model can be applied in product development to prioritize
features and functionalities based on customer needs and expectations.
By categorizing features into the five Kano categories, product managers
can identify which features are essential, which are nice to have, and
which can create a competitive advantage.

The Kano model can also help product managers understand customer
preferences and make informed decisions about resource allocation and
product development. By focusing on Must-be Quality and One-dimensional
Quality features, product managers can ensure that the product meets
basic customer requirements and maximizes customer satisfaction.

In conclusion, the Kano model is a valuable tool for prioritizing
features and functionalities in product development. By understanding
customer preferences and categorizing features into the five Kano
categories, product managers can create products that meet customer
needs and expectations, leading to higher customer satisfaction and
competitive advantage.
